# Insite

Insite is an Android app that posts challenges to those who consider themselves critical thinkers. A challenge is a thought experiment, but often one that might be presented during a job interview to allow employers to gauge the degree of critical thinking a potential candidate has. This app is available on Google Play at:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.johannrosenberg.insite

In this app, challenges are organized into categories such as automotive, business, home ownership, relationships and so on. There is a debate about what constitutes critical thinking, with side of the argument believing that the attributes that make up critical thinking can be used in any scenario while the opposing argument believes that criticial thinking is specific to the field that someone has expertise in. In reality, it is probably a combination of both these arguments to some degree.

The challenges posted in the app are provided a solution but such solutions are by no means the only one. There are often multiple solutions that can employed to solve a challenge with some being better than others under different context.

In order to facilitate a discussion around challenges, the sub Reddit channel "**CriticalThinkn**" has been set up to allow you to post challenges as well as provide a discussion around the challenge and possible solutions. Anyone can post a challenge along with their solution. Visit:

https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalThinkn

The app also provides a button that is linked to the Reddit discussion of the challenge, allowing mobile users to view the discussion.

When a challenge on Reddit has been posted with enough user interest and a viable solution has been provided, a copy of the challenge along with its solution will be accessible from this app.  When I decide to include someone's challenge in the app, I'll reach out to the person who posted the challenge and if they choose, they can provide their name, photo and bio along with two links that will be included in the app. All app data is retrieved at runtime from Github and located in this repository.

Optionally, if you're someone who doesn't want to use Reddit but has a worthy challenge, please send it to me at rosenberg.stories@gmail.com

Make sure you properly format your challenge, like this:

**Title**: A short title that clearly indicates what the challenge is about. The title is what users will see scrolling in the app.

**Description**: A description of the challenge in as much detail as possible.

**Solution**: A list of all the things a person must undertake to solve the challenge. In other words, what are the steps that a critical thinker would take to solve the challenge. These must be listed in a numbered list. Some challenges might require certain steps to be taken in order of priority and you should make sure that the items you list are in the order that make sense. For other types of challenges, the order in which the steps are taken may not be important.

Although the app currently only shows just one solution for a particular challenge, the solution may at some point be updated or replaced entirely with a different one. This often happens especially where technology is involved and better solutions emerge over time.



You don't need a college degree to be a critical thinker. Critical thinking is something that people from all walks of life will use, especially when they've been exposed to a significant amount of experience in some particular field and are required to think of a pragmatic path to a solution that solves some problem. Even some of the best critical thinkers will always discover something new that they hadn't thought about before. The intention of this app is to focus on those problems that a lot of people in general, or people within your narrower field of expertise are experiencing and offer a viable solution.
